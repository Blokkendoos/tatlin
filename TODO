ui:
* more file stats either in the 3D window or the status bar
* settings dialog

gcode:
* color legend in 3D window
* show layer entry/exit points
* tooltips with gcode info - would be nice to display the full gcode line, but that seems too memory-intensive

stl:
* better lighting
* lay flat on platform (medium)
* custom offset

long-term:
* undo/redo (low)
